Visual feedback (such as labels, colors, and icons) and touch feedback show users what is available in the UI.

Navigation

Navigation can have clear task flows with minimal steps, easy-to-locate controls and clear labeling. Focus control, or the ability to control keyboard and reading focus, can be implemented for frequently used tasks.

Every added button, image, and line of text increases the complexity of a UI. You can simplify how your UI is understood by using:

Clearly visible elements
Sufficient contrast and size
A clear hierarchy of importance
Key information that is discernable at a glance
To convey an item’s relative level of importance:

Place important actions at the top or bottom of the screen (reachable with shortcuts)
Place related items of a similar hierarchy next to each other"
Foundations,Layout,Clickable,soft,Accessibility Touch and pointer target sizes,"Touch targets are the parts of the screen that respond to user input, extending beyond the visual bounds of an element. For example, an icon may appear to be 24 x 24dp, but the padding surrounding it comprises the full 48 x 48dp touch target. 
For most platforms, consider making touch targets at least 48 x 48dp. A touch target this size results in a physical size of about 9mm, regardless of screen size. The recommended target size for touchscreen elements is 7-10mm. It may be appropriate to use larger touch targets to accommodate a larger spectrum of users.
Note: iOS recommends 44 x 44dp targets. 
Pointer targets are similar to touch targets, but are implemented by motion-tracking pointer devices such as a mouse or a stylus. "

Foundations,Color,Color,soft,Accessibility Contrast ratios,"
Color contrast is important for users to distinguish various text and non-text elements. Higher contrast makes the imagery easier to see, while low-contrast images may be difficult for some users to differentiate in bright or low light conditions, such as on a very sunny day or at night.
Contrast ratios represent how different one color is from another color, commonly written as 1:1 or 21:1. The greater the difference is between the two numbers in the ratio, the greater the difference in relative luminance between the colors. The contrast ratio between a color and its background ranges from 1-21 based on its luminance (the intensity of light emitted) according to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
The W3C recommends the following contrast ratios for body text and image text
| Text type                                                             | Color contrast ratio         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Large text (at 14 pt bold/18 pt regular and up) and graphics`` | 3:1 against the background   |
| Small text``                                                   | 4.5:1 against the background |

When placing components together in a cluster, use components or types of components that each achieve at least 3:1 contrast between themselves and the background.

When text resizing isn't controlled by the device OS, offer multipliers such as 1.5x or 2x to allow users to increase the text size. Using multipliers to scale text can result in values with decimals, but this approach is more feasible for implementation.

To calculate a font's size using multipliers, take the default font size (density = 0) and multiply it by the scale value.

By classifying and labeling sections of a page, structural information that is conveyed visually through layout design can also be represented in code.
Landmarks are large blocks of content that establish the high-level structure of your layout. They're a set of ARIA roles that provide easy access to, and important meaning for, common content areas of a web page. 

There are eight landmark roles: navigation, search, main, banner, complementary, contentinfo, region, and form. 

The eight landmark roles in the W3C ARIA guidelines include:

Navigation: Contains lists of navigation links (there can be multiple, in which case you should differentiate in label)
Search: A search field 
Main: The main content area as defined by UX. There should be only one.
Banner: Typically the header; content repeated from page to page, often contains navigation and toolbars. There should be only one.
Complementary: A sidebar or aside to main content that can stand alone without the main content
Contentinfo: Typically the footer; contains information describing the site and its content (for example,  copyright). There should be only one.
Region: Content regions are important content blocks. They can be nested inside the “main” landmark. Regions should be labeled with names that make the purpose of that region clear. 
Form: Takes and stores user info"

Define the initial focus when a user loads a screen, as well as initial focus for components with multiple interactive elements, like a complex card or a dialog.
Focus is particularly important when an element is activated by the user or the user changes context. 

For example, when a dialog is triggered, check for the following:

Focus is set to the dialog component, likely to a specific interactive element within the dialog such as a text input field or edit button
When the user closes or cancels the dialog, focus returns to the interactive element that initiated the action"
Foundations,Flow,Clickable,soft,Accessibility Define any atypical key traversal through the page and components,"Tab typically moves focus between interactive elements and is often used as primary navigation. Tab + Shift reverses direction.

Foundations,Layout,Platform,soft,Layout Foldable devices,"Fold
The fold of a foldable device divides the screen into two portions, either horizontally or vertically. The fold can be a flexible area of the screen or, on dual-screen devices, a hinge that separates two displays.

A flexible fold is barely visible, although some users may feel a tactile difference on the screen surface. Content can flow over the fold fairly easily.

Center fold of a foldable device layout.
Folds are typically found in the center of the device screen and can present a seamless experience.

On devices with a physical hinge, designing the screen as two distinct sections (separate window areas or panes) allows a composition to work well across the hinge and screens.

A physical hinge separates two parts. There is no display hardware in this region.

Device state
Foldable devices can have several physical states: folded, open flat, and tabletop.

Folded
The folded state can include a front screen, which often fits in the compact window size class, just like a mobile phone in portrait orientation.

Open flat
An open flat state refers to the fully opened screen, which usually increases the window size class to medium or expanded. An open device can be used in landscape or portrait orientations.

Open portrait state of a mobile device.
In an open portrait state, the longer device edge is vertical while the shorter edge is horizontal.

Open landscape state of a mobile device.
In an open landscape state, the longer device edge is horizontal while the vertical edge is shorter.

Tabletop
Tabletop refers to a half-opened state forming a rough 90 degree angle, with one half of the device resting on a surface. This posture resembles a laptop.

UI controls near the fold can be difficult for users to access, and text overlaying the fold can be hard to read.

Note that some design tools also use bounding boxes for typesetting, but their methods vary and will need to be reconciled with the engineering implementation.

In web UIs, the line height and bounding box height are the same. Text is vertically centered within the bounding box, following the “half-leading” behavior established by CSS.

The vertical position of the text isn’t controlled directly, but through the combination of the bounding box and font metrics.

Line height is the space between each line of text and is directly connected to type size.

Material’s type tokens are optimized for intended size and use.

An example of larger type with a line height ratio of 1.2
For larger type legibility using styles like title, headline, and display, we recommend a line height ratio of 1.2 times the type size

An example of body type with a line height ratio of 1.5
For smaller body copy using styles like body and label, we recommend a line height ratio around 1.5 times the type size. If your line height is too tight, you’ll undermine the flow of the text. Too loose, and the lines won’t feel cohesive.
Tabular numbers 

 Use tabular figures (also known as monospaced numbers) rather than proportional digits in tables or places where values may change often, such as clocks.

Text should achieve sufficient contrast between its color and that of its background. Sufficient contrast depends on the size of the text and the level of accessibility required.
